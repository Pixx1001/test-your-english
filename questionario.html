							<h2 id="current" onclick="deleta();">WHAT IS HTML?</h2>
							HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected
							to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting ;
							and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the
							demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the » W3C, the organisation charged
							with designing and maintaining the language. The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language.<br/><br/>
							<b> •	HYPERTEXT</b> is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks
							which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is HYPER just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place
							on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.<br/>
							<b> •	MARKUP</b> is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (ITALICISED
							text, for example).<br/>
							<b> •	HTML </b>is a LANGUAGE, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.<br/>

					<h2>Questão 2:</h2>

					<p>
						<h2>WHAT ARE STYLESHEETS?</h2>
						In the late ‘90s, HTML coders noticed that they were retyping the same old tags again and again on the same page, leading
						to bigger HTML files and above all, time consumption and frustration. You may have found yourself in the same situation,
						adding in mountains of font tags, despite wanting them all the same; or using tricks like invisible gifs for spacing.
						Then, someone had a great idea: have one file that defines all the values that those piles of tags would have done,
						and then have all your pages checking this file and formatting your pages accordingly. You can therefore leave out
						most of the formatting tags in HTML and use only nice structural elements (like headings, paragraphs and links) — separating
						structure and presentation. In late 1996 CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) became a reality, forged by our good friends the
						» World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Your stylesheet acts as a partner to your HTML code; taking care of all the layout,
						fonts, colours and overall LOOK of your site.

						<h2>PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
						Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can

						first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program. Computer science is not
						the study of programming. Programming, however, is an important part of what a computer scientist does. Programming

						<h2>PRIVACY</h2>
						Social media sites have a variety of privacy settings you can adjust. This means you can control who sees your profile page
						and other information you share on the site. Some people do not mind having their personal information available for
						anyone to view online. However, we strongly recommend that you don't publish your index address and be mindful of posting
						other personal information about yourself (including your birthday), or others especially if you don't have their permission.
						It's worth keeping in mind that if malicious parties have access to your full name and date of birth and using other
						available information – for example which suburb you live in - it is possible that you could fall victim to identity
						theft. Just as you wouldn't give your mobile number or bank details to anyone who asked, you should guard access to
						all the details of your social networking account. For more on this issue, visit the SCAMwatch website. Some people
						who use social media prefer only to allow people they have officially become friends with to see their profile and
						other information. It is important to note that for most social media sites (including Facebook) the default privacy
						setting is NOT to hide your information when you sign up. If you don't want your profile and other information to be
						seen by people who aren't a "friend" or "follower", you will have to check these settings and adjust them accordingly
						after you sign up. You can usually do this on the site - look for a link to "Privacy" or "Settings" to adjust this.

						<h2>WEBSITE HISTORY</h2>
						The first websites were created in the early 1990s.[1] These sites were manually written in HTML. Over time, software was
						created to help design web pages and by 1998 Dreamweaver had been established as the industry leader; however, some
						have criticized the quality of the code produced by such software as being overblown and reliant on tables. As the
						industry moved towards W3C standards, Dreamweaver and others were criticized for not being compliant. Compliance has
						improved over time, but many professionals still prefer to write optimized markup by hand. Open source tools were typically
						developed to the standards, and made fewer exceptions for the then dominant Internet Explorer's deviations from the
						standards. The W3C started Amaya in 1996 to showcase Web technologies in a fully featured Web client. This was to provide
						a framework that integrated lots of W3C technologies in a single, consistent environment. Amaya started as an HTML
						and CSS editor and now supports XML, XHTML, MathML, and SVG.[2] Geocities was one of the first more modern website
						builders that didn't require any technical skills. Five years after its launch in 1994 Yahoo! purchased it for $3.6
						billion. After becoming technically outdated it was shut down in April 2009.[3]

						areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary
						software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering
						different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term web design is normally
						used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark
						up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected
						to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up
						to date with web accessibility guidelines. </p>

						<h2>END OF THE FIRST BROWSER WARS</h2>
						During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence, enabling thousands of developers to
						participate in improving the software. However, they decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development
						of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform.[5] The Web Standards Project was formed
						and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 tests. 2000 was a big
						year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant as it was the first browser that fully
						supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully
						support the PNG image format.[5] During this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official
						loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.[5]

						By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged typeface or colophon. At the level of mass communication

						many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Related
						tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management
						of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process,

						<h1> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1>
						Main articles: Programming language and List of programming languages Different programming languages support different styles
						of programming (called programming paradigms). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such
						as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the
						programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding
						enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the
						efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level"
						to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level"
						languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in "high-level"
						languages than in "low-level" ones. Allen Downey, in his book How To Think Like A Computer Scientist, writes: The details
						look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language: • Input: Gather
						data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device. • Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or
						other device. • Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication. • Conditional Execution:
						Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements. • Repetition: Perform some action
						repeatedly, usually with some variation. Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by
						shared libraries. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of
						passing arguments), then these functions may be written in any other language.

						<h2> WEB SECURITY</h2>
						For criminals, the Web has become a venue to spread malware and engage in a range of cybercrimes, including identity theft,
						fraud, espionage and intelligence gathering.[47] Web-based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security
						concerns,[48][49] and as measured by Google, about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code.[50] Most web-based
						attacks take place on legitimate websites, and most, as measured by Sophos, are hosted in the United States, China
						and Russia.[51] The most common of all malware threats is SQL injection attacks against websites.[52] Through HTML
						and URIs, the Web was vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) that came with the introduction of JavaScript[53]
						and were exacerbated to some degree by Web 2.0 and Ajax web design that favours the use of scripts.[54] Today by one
						estimate, 70% of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users.[55] Phishing is another common threat to the
						Web. "SA, the Security Division of EMC, today announced the findings of its January 2013 Fraud Report, estimating the
						global losses from phishing at $1.5 Billion in 2012".[56] Two of the well-known phishing methods are Covert Redirect
						and Open Redirect. Proposed solutions vary. Large security companies like McAfee already design governance and compliance
						suites to meet post-9/11 regulations,[57] and some, like Finjan have recommended active real-time inspection of programming
						code and all content regardless of its source.[47] Some have argued that for enterprises to see Web security as a business
						opportunity rather than a cost centre,[58] while others call for "ubiquitous, always-on digital rights management"
						enforced in the infrastructure to replace the hundreds of companies that secure data and networks.[59] Jonathan Zittrain
						has said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the Internet.[60]

						end-user can use their media player to begin to play the data file (such as a digital file of a movie or song) before
						the entire file has been transmitted. Distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically
						to telecommunications networks, as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g. radio, television)
						or inherently non-streaming (e.g. books, video cassettes, audio CDs). For example, in the 1930s, elevator music was
						among the earliest popularly available streaming media; nowadays Internet television is a common form of streamed media.
						The term "streaming media" can apply to media other than video and audio such as live closed captioning, ticker tape,
						and real-time text, which are all considered "streaming text". The term "streaming" was first used for tape drives
						made by Data Electronics Inc. for drives meant to slowly ramp up and run for the entire track; the slow ramp times
						resulted in lower drive costs, making a more competitive product. "Streaming" was applied in the early 1990s as a better
						description for video on demand on IP networks; at the time such video was usually referred to as "store and forward
						video",[1]which was misleading nomenclature.

					<h2>Questão 25:</h2>
					<p>
						<h2>ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING</h2>Electronic publishing (also referred to as e-publishing or digital publishing or online publishing)
						includes the digital publication of e-books, digital magazines, and the development of digital libraries and catalogues.
						Electronic publishing has become common in scientific publishing where it has been argued that peer-reviewed scientific
						journals are in the process of being replaced by electronic publishing. It is also becoming common to distribute books,
						magazines, and newspapers to consumers through tablet reading devices, a market that is growing by millions each year,[1]
						generated by online vendors such as Apple's iTunes bookstore, Amazon's bookstore for Kindle, and books in the Google
						Play Bookstore. Market research suggests that half of all magazine and newspaper circulation will be via digital delivery
						by the end of 2015[2] and that half of all reading in the United States will be done without paper by 2015</p>
