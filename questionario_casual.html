			  <p><h2 id="current" onclick="deleta();">WHAT IS HTML?</h2>
				HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These
				websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to
				the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the
				basics being accessible to most people in one sitting
				; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.
				It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to
				meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet
				audience under the direction of the » W3C, the organisation
				charged with designing and maintaining the language.
				The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language.<br/><br/>
				<b> •	HYPERTEXT</b> is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is HYPER just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.<br/>
				<b> •	MARKUP</b> is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (ITALICISED text, for example).<br/>
				<b> •	HTML </b>is a LANGUAGE, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.<br/>

			<h2>Questão 2:</h2>

			<p><h2>WHAT ARE STYLESHEETS?</h2>
			  In the late ‘90s, HTML coders noticed that they were retyping the same
			  old tags again and again on the same page, leading to bigger HTML files
			  and above all, time consumption and frustration. You may have found 
			  yourself in the same situation, adding in mountains of font tags, despite
			  wanting them all the same; or using tricks like invisible gifs for spacing.
			  Then, someone had a great idea: have one file that defines all the values
			  that those piles of tags would have done, and then have all your pages 
			  checking this file and formatting your pages accordingly. You can therefore
			  leave out most of the formatting tags in HTML and use only nice structural
			  elements (like headings, paragraphs and links) — separating structure and presentation.
			  In late 1996 CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) became a reality, forged by our
			  good friends the » World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Your stylesheet acts
			  as a partner to your HTML code; taking care of all the layout, fonts,
			  colours and overall LOOK of your site.

			<h2>Questão 3:</h2>

			<p><h2>PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
			  Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a
			  notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a
			  computer. Although many programming languages and many different types 
			  of computers exist, the important first step is the need to have the 
			  solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.
			  Computer science is not the study of programming. Programming, however,
			  is an important part of what a computer scientist does. Programming is
			  often the way that we create a representation for our solutions.
			  Therefore, this language representation and the process of creating

Depending on the social media site you're using, a profile page usually allows you to post a picture and a few general details about you and your interests. Your friends will be able to see your profile page and the information that you share. They will also be able to leave comments or share information with you on your profile page. When signing up you don't have to fill all the fields in your profile – think carefully about what you want people to know about you before you fill it in. You can usually adjust this information later on if you need to.

			<p><h2>PRIVACY</h2>
			  Social media sites have a variety of privacy settings you can adjust. This means you can control who sees your profile page and other information you share on the site. Some people do not mind having their personal information available for anyone to view online. However, we strongly recommend that you don't publish your index address and be mindful of posting other personal information about yourself (including your birthday), or others especially if you don't have their permission.
			  It's worth keeping in mind that if malicious parties have access to your full name and date of birth and using other available information – for example which suburb you live in - it is possible that you could fall victim to identity theft. Just as you wouldn't give your mobile number or bank details to anyone who asked, you should guard access to all the details of your social networking account. For more on this issue, visit the SCAMwatch website.
			  Some people who use social media prefer only to allow people they have officially become friends with to see their profile and other information. It is important to note that for most social media sites (including Facebook) the default privacy setting is NOT to hide your information when you sign up. If you don't want your profile and other information to be seen by people who aren't a "friend" or "follower", you will have to check these settings and adjust them accordingly after you sign up. You can usually do this on the site - look for a link to "Privacy" or "Settings" to adjust this.
